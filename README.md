## Alpha Development Research System

**ADRS** is a library that provides re-usable, extensible, atomic primitives (e.g. modeling, data loading, signal generation) to ease alpha research and discovery which later can be used for backtesting, simulation and trading signals generation.

### Installation

```sh
pip install adrs
```
